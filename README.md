# DegreePlanner

Degree Planner was created using Node.js and is currently configured to read input from JSON files.

The Degree Planner application uses a BFS algorithm to create an optimized plan for completing a degree.  After providing input of all courses required, Degree Planner prioritizes completing courses with long prerequisite chains and provides the user with a list of courses to take each semester.
